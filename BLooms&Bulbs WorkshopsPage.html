<h3>New Composting Workshop!</h3>

  whether you plan to invest in a commercial composite bin or simply start a composite pile in the corner of your garden. You will be amazed at how<br>
  quickly you can produce rich, nutrient-filled compost with only a little effort. Use this black gold to amend your soil naturally, to encourage the<br>
  growth of healthy plants. Not only will you create rich soil and save water-you will also reduce trash at the landfill be recycling your kitchen<br>
  scraps and garden materials.</p>
<p> We offer this free workshop on a first-come, first-serve basis. All workshop participants will receive a packet of bacteria to kick-start their<br>
  composting process. Our speaker will be Ann Porter from the County Extension Office. Ann Recently completed her Master Composter<br>
